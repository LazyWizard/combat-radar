This radar includes an extensible plugin system, allowing other mods to add custom element rendering with (relative) ease.\n\nYou can find the files to configure the radar in data/config/radar/\n\nPlease note that this mod deliberately uses the incredibly outdated OpenGL 1.x immediate mode to match core Starsector and should not be used as a guideline for working with OpenGL elsewhere. Use shaders, people!",
