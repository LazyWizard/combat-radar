 Common Radar
==============

This mod adds a simple radar to the combat and campaign layers of Starsector. This radar includes an extensible plugin system, allowing other mods to add custom element rendering with (relative) ease.


**Please note that this mod deliberately uses the *incredibly* outdated OpenGL 1.x immediate mode to match core Starsector and should *not* be used as a guideline for working with OpenGL elsewhere. Use shaders, people!**
