 2.1 (November XX, 2015)
=========================
(thanks to MesoTroniK for spritework and extensive help testing new features)
Updated to be compatible with Starsector 0.7a
The "maxShown" setting has been enabled for all renderers, defaults increased
Added "verticesPerCircle" setting, increase this for smoother radar rings
Asteroid renderer (both campaign and combat) changes:
 - Uses a sprite now, should look much smoother
 - Scaled based on their true size, not a flat value multiplied by zoom level
Campaign fleet renderer changes:
 - Uses a sprite now, should look much smoother
 - Fixed issue where player fleet would flash bounty colors if a faction was
   paying for kills against their enemies and was hostile towards the player
Planet renderer changes:
 - Uses vanilla map icons instead of polygons
 - Differentiates between planets and stars
Combat readiness renderer changes:
 - Bar is dimmed until you have started losing combat readiness
 - Remaining peak CR timer is shown as a white line down the middle of the bar
Combat ship renderer changes:
 - Separated ship and shield rendering
 - Increased transparency of shields
 - Added smoothing to shields (might cause artifacts on some cards, let me know)
 - Bumped default shield segment count from 18 (?!) to 64
 - Transparency of ship contacts is based on the alpha of the actual sprite
   - Ships with custom right click ship systems won't be momentarily
     translucent on the radar when using them now (ex: Exigency Incorporated)
   - Fighters taking off or landing on a carrier should fade in/out
 - Removed "phasedShipAlphaMult" setting, added "minShipAlphaMult"
   (ships with 0 alpha will be completely invisible regardless of this setting)
 - Polygon triangulator is now a config file option, added the other Slick2D
   triangulator implementations
 - Fixed bug causing shields to have the wrong number of segments
 - Bumped default fighter contact scaling from 175% to 225% actual size
 - Use sprite size instead of collision radius for calculating fighter size
   (this should fix the issue with shield drones and their oversized radius)
 - Fixed issue where a fighter's shields weren't being scaled
Missile renderer changes:
 - Uses a sprite now, should look much smoother, sprite shows facing of missile
 - Differentiates between missiles and flares
 - Missile contacts are the same size at every zoom level
 - New settings: "missileContactSize" and "flareContactSize"

 2.0 (October 04, 2015)
========================
Radar framerate is now separate from Starsector's framerate, defaults to 20 FPS
Merged radar settings into a single file, data/config/radar/radar_settings.json
Combined campaign and combat radars into one codebase
Replaced CampaignRadar and CombatRadar with a generic CommonRadar interface
Added excluded_ships.csv, can exclude single hulls or ones with certain prefixes
Added excluded_missiles.csv, can exclude missiles by their projectile ID
Added RadarSettings class to retrieve loaded renderers and radar settings
Added getCurrentSightRadius() to CommonRadar interface
Improved icon for relays in the campaign
All renderers now support a "maxShown" setting where valid
Campaign fleet renderer changes:
 - Fleets with a bounty on their head are now shown as gold on the radar
   (faction-level bounties flash between gold and their regular color so you
    won't accidently chase/attack a friendly faction)
Combat progress renderer changes:
 - Relative fleet balance calculation is no longer based on information that
   the player can't obtain in-game, is instead now based on the ship's fleet
   point costs (with a 75% penalty to calculated strength for civilian ships)
New combat renderer: MapBorderRenderer
 - Displays retreat zones in yellow
 - Displays gravity barrier line in red
 - Displays out of bounds in grey
New combat renderer: ShipRenderer
 - Replaces ShipSimpleRenderer and ShipPolygonRenderer
 - Draws proper polygons for ships instead of approximations like old system
 - Will fall back to approximations on ships that can't be triangulated (only
   the Paragon in vanilla and a handful of ships in existing mods)
 - To draw ships as triangles instead (like with the old ShipSimpleRenderer),
   change "simpleMode" to true in radar_settings.json under "shipRenderer"
 - Shields are drawn filled, can be reverted to the old behavior by changing
   "drawSolidShields" to false in radar_settings.json under "shipRenderer"
New utility class: DrawQueue
 - Aids in efficiently drawing many primitive shapes multiple frames in a row
 - Handles native buffer allocation/data/resizing automatically
 - Uses VBOs if the user's card supports them (hint: it does)
New utility class: ShapeUtils
 - Calculates vertices (as float arrays) for common shapes
All interfaces are now fully documented (see javadoc.zip in mod folder)
Miscellaneous optimizations and improvements

 1.1f (March 06, 2015)
=======================
Fixed a bug that caused intermittent radar corruption in the campaign
Lines and points on the radar should look much sharper now (thanks Alex)

 1.1e (February 12, 2015)
==========================
Stations and planets with the "comm_relay" tag aren't considered relays
The campaign radar won't draw anything with the tag "radar_nodraw"

 1.1d (December 09, 2014)
==========================
Hopefully fixed a bug where campaign radar components would occasionally vanish

 1.1c (December 03, 2014)
==========================
The radar is no longer drawn over menus or when the HUD is turned off
Greatly increased the speed of the battle progress bar animation
Fixed crash in ShipPolygonRenderer when rendering ships that lack bounds
Radar no longer reactivates when the player's ship is fully destroyed

 1.1b (October 23, 2014)
=========================
Campaign fleet renderer changes:
 - Fleets are only colored red if they are hostile towards the player
Battle progress bar changes:
 - Doesn't show initial relative fleet strengths in a simulation battle
 - Ignores ships still in picker in simulation battles
 - Doesn't count the reserves of a fleet in full retreat

 1.1 (October 21, 2014)
========================
Updated to support Starsector .65a
Station rendering fixed in campaign
Comm relays are now included on the campaign radar
Zooming is now done using +/-, toggling the radar on/off is still K by default
Zooming in/out is now animated
